## MyTokenWallet.com

* What is MyTokenWallet?
It is a high security fork of MyEtherWallet. Paranoid Version.

* Trust or not, it's your choice!
Just one word! It is sometimes better to trust an absolute End to End security stream as to 
trust you own ass.

My security for you is not only based on secure js, css, svg, html, the primary security is based
on the stream to get the code. Many firewall has a man in the middle server, because they have to
controll the own infrastructure.

Use my website behind such a mitm firewall! Ohh, what's that: 
1. Site is not available or
2. SSl Error or
3. Warning from your network admin, that the site https://myTokenWallet.com 'not scanning anything'

Wondering? How could it possible to access online banking behind such a mitm firewall or proxy?

Let me know, if you have issues. Happy testing. 
more later,,,,,
