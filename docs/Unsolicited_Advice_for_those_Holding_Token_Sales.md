## [WIP] Unsolicited Advice for those Holding Token Sales

## Building a product is easy...dealing with people is hard

_If you are having a token sale you now have a fiduciary and moral
responsibility to your users (who are now your investors). Building a
product is easy...dealing with people is hard. If you are not prepared
to support, educate, and set your users up for success, do not have a
token sale. Seriously._

1. Publish your token sale address ahead of time ( **at least** 24
   hours)

2. Make sure you have secured all platforms - website, social media,
   everything. There will be very diligent attempts to hack you. Do not
   take this lightly and do not think you cannot be hacked. A light
   pentest on your web security would be in everyones best interest.
   Check hackerone or upwork.

3. Educate users on the importance of not sending to any random address
   and properly securing their account. e.g. PRIVATE KEYS ARE PRIVATE!
   PROTECT THEM!

4. Educate your users on how to safely participate using a number of
   clients. Provide tutorials with video and/or images.

5. Focus on making Ethereum better and contributing to the larger
   ecoysystem. If you do this, you will go places as most people are too
   self-centered at this point. If Ethereum is not easy-to-use, secure,
   and improving, **your product and users will fail too.**

6. Around the week of your token sale, make sure you have at least one
   person monitoring all social media channels 24/7 to gain trust,
   report scams, and ensure phishing links, fake addresses, and
   misinformation are quickly called out and removed.

7. Make sure you provide customer support before, during, and after your
   token sale. Scammers get away with more if you aren't accessible.

8. Get an ENS name for your token sale.

9. Get all contracts verified on etherscan.io beforehand. Teach users
   how to check if it is verified, and how to check comments on
   etherscan.io, and how to tell if they are sending to a normal account
   or contract (sending to a normal account would indicate a scam)

10. Encourage users to get a hardware wallet or run MEW offline or run a
    full node.

11. Get your token on MTW & provide custom message when users enter your
    address:
    [Adding_a_Custom_Token_to_MyTokenWallet](Adding_a_Custom_Token_to_MyTokenWallet.md)
