## Why is the address showing on my TREZOR / Ledger different than the address I am sending to when sending tokens?


When you send your TOKENS, you are NOT sending TOKENS from your address
to the address you want them to arrive at.

You are sending a STRING OF DATA in the DATA FIELD with the address you
want the TOKENS to go to.

In order to send that DATA, you need to send a TRANSACTION. The
transaction goes to the TOKENS CONTRACT ADDRESS along with 0 ETH.

Therefore when you look at your LEDGER/TREZOR, it will show the TOKENS
CONTRACT ADDRESS.

It will NOT show the address you are sending to.

This is how the system works.
