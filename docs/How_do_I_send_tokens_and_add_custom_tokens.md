Sending & Adding Tokens
-----------------------

[Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/) is a great way to explore tokens and find the decimals of a token.
1. Navigate to the "Send Ether & Tokens" page.
2. Unlock your wallet.
3. Enter the address you would like to send to in the "To Address:" field.
4. Enter the amount you would like to send.
5. Select which token you would like to send.
6. **If you do not see the token listed:**

   * In the sidebar, click "Add Custom Token".
   * Enter the address, name, and decimals of the token. These are provided by the developers of the token and are also needed when you "Add a Watch Token" to Mist.
   * Click "Save".
   * You can now send that token as well as see it's balance in the sidebar.

7. Click "Generate Transaction".

8. A couple more fields will appear. This is your browser generating the transaction.
9. Click the blue "Send Transaction" button below that.
10. A pop-up will appear. Verify that the amount and the address you are sending to are correct. Then click "Yes, I am sure! Make transaction." button.
11. The transaction will be submitted. The TX ID will display. You can click that TX ID to see it on the blockchain.
