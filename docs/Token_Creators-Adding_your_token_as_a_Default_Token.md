[Token Creators] Adding your token as a Default Token
-----------------------------------------------------

## [If you are a person experimenting with tokens, you can add a token to your local version of MyTokenWallet](https://github.com/Zwilla/mytokenwallet.com/blob/master/docs)

*** ** * ** ***

### 1. If you have a token that other people also have, or will have in the coming days, you can add it to our site. You will need:

* **Name** or **Symbol** of your token
* **Address** of your token
* **Decimals**
* **Your official Website and/or** **Slack / Reddit / Forum / Chat / Whatever**
* **Your direct customer support email**
  * Due to high numbers of token sale holders NOT providing support to their investors, we will remove your token if you do not help the people who made you millionaires.

*** ** * ** ***

### 2. Submit your Tokens as Default Tokens

* Go to https://github.com/Zwilla/mytokenwallet.com/blob/master/app/scripts/tokens/ethTokens.json
* Login or join Github.
* Click the pencil icon in upper right.
* Scroll to the letter of your token (they are in alpha order)
* Copy an existing token starting at the { and ending with },
* Replace that information with your address, decimals, and symbol
* At the bottom under "Commit changes" type "Added _____ Token to Defaults" in the title box
* In the bigger box below that: add the links to your website, slack community, reddit, chat, whatever will help people if they have trouble and your support email address
* Click the green "Propose File change" button.
* This next page is a review of what you did.
* Click the "Create Pull Request" button.....twice.
* That's it. You successfully made a new pull request! Tell all your friends.
* We will now review it and pull it in and it will be made live on the site. We may also ask you questions if something is confusing for whatever reason.

### 3. Add your token sale address & manual gas limits to ensure a smooth sale

* Go here https://github.com/Zwilla/mytokenwallet.com/blob/master/app/scripts/customGas.js
* Find an existing entry that is over, or use our donation address (the top one)
* Replace the information with your information:
* Address: The address users will be sending to
* Gas Limit: The gas limit you are recommending that ensures there will be no Out of Gas errors.
* Data: Optional. If there is a standard data field, add that string.
* Message: Optional. If people need to generate data, include a note here to remind them. You can include the block start times or date and what token sale it is for.
* At the bottom under "Commit changes" type "Manual gas limits for upcoming _____ token" in the title box.

### 4. Adding your Contract / ABI

We now provide users with the ability to enter the address and it auto-populate with the ABI. If you have a contract (beyond the standard token contract) that users will be interacting with:
* https://github.com/Zwilla/mytokenwallet.com/blob/master/app/scripts/abiDefinitions/ethAbi.json
* Copy from { to },
* Replace information with your contract name, address, and ABI.
