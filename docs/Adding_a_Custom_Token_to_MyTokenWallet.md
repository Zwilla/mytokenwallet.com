Now that you have a Wallet and know how to check the balance through
using [**MyTokenWallet**](https://myTokenWallet.com/) , let's learn how to add a custom Ethereum
Token! To be clear, we will be adding a Token someone has already
created on the Ethereum Blockchain, not actually creating a brand new
token. We will cover creating custom Tokens in a future post.

Head on over to [**MyTokenWallet**](https://myTokenWallet.com/) and
go to the ' **View Wallet Info** ' section. Unlock your wallet and then
follow the steps below. If you are unsure about this process, refer back
to the 'Checking your Ethereum Wallet Balance' post!

## Adding a Custom Token


1. Click the ' **Add Custom Token** ' button

2. You should be prompted to enter 3 pieces of information, the Address,
   Token Symbol, and Decimals.

3. Enter the Contract Address in the 'Address' field, the Token Symbol
   in the 'Token Symbol' field, and the number of decimals the token
   goes back to. For this example, we will use the vSlice token.

4. After entering the above information, click ' **Save** ' and that is
   it! You should now see the added Token under ' **Token Balances:** '
   right below your Ether balance.

## Summary


This is an extremely easy and quick process. The hardest part is
probably finding the information needed to add the Token, but most
companies will make it easy to find. Now go out and add the hundreds of
custom tokens and collect em all!

For discussion, how many Tokens have you added and what are they?
